# Welcome to my GitHub profile.üëã

I created this GitHub profile when I was studied ISAM at Rey Juan Carlos University.

Now, I use this profile to improve and learn ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![Javasript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E) and ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white).

# About me

I am Manuel Salcedo and I'm 25 years old. I was born in Madrid, Spain :es: . I was studied "Ingenier√≠a de Sistemas Audiovisuales y Multimedia" at Rey Juan Carlos University. I like program in HTML and JS although I can make programs with other programming languages like Python :computer: .

## What am I doing?

Now, I am working to [MoMe](https://es.linkedin.com/company/monitorizacion-y-medidas-mome).In this company, I work as Telecommunications engineer focused on image and sound and as programmer where I have been learning and working with [Scala software](https://scala.com/en/). Scala software has Python to support to run his scripts, so I have worked with both programming languajes.

  * I am developing a app to get and analize soundscape quizs data.

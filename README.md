# Welcome to my GitHub profile.ðŸ‘‹

I created this GitHub profile when I was studied ISAM at Rey Juan Carlos University.

Now, I use this profile to improve and learn HTML, Javascript and CSS.

## What am I doing now?

Now, I am developing my practices of "LTAW" subject.
  
  * I'm adding more options and improving the web of Cubingenio (My fictitious website store). 
  * I'm developing a better opening website Chat.
 
You can see it here :point_right: [P5](https://github.com/SalcedoManuel/2020-2021-LTAW-Practicas/tree/main/P5) 

## What have I already done?

In Proyectos repository I have some projects like English Questionaries. :gb:
